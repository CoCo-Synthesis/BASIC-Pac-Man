# BASIC-PAC-MAN

A Pac-Man style game written in BASIC for the Tandy Color Computer 3. Released for SEPTANDY 2025 by **CoCo-Synthesis**.

## History

I started working on this game around 1992 while in college.  I had discovered the [FontOGenic III](https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Disks/Applications/Fontogenic%203%20%28Todd%20Knudsen%29%20%28Coco%203%29.zip) BASIC program that allowed you to create and save custom character sets that could be used with the BASIC HPRINT command and this had me thinking I could make a Pac Man game that used simple text screen mechanics but with the benefit of higher resolution graphics.  Even though I made substantial progress on the game, I never achieved a version that was playable, let alone complete.

33 years later...

I rescued my old Color Computer 3 from my parent's attic, complete with almost 100 5.25" floppy diskettes that had been baking in the Texas heat for close to thirty years.  After getting Drivewire working, I was able to rescue many of my old projects from those fragile floppies, including my incomplete Pac-Man program.

Using Visual Studio Code, I was able to restart my old work in progress.  Copilot was able to add some quick comments to the code to get me up to speed on what my old code was doing.  From there, it was not just a matter of finishing the existing code, it was also a matter of optimizing it so that it was playable and not too slow.
